# A method for investigating transmission distortion among human sperm 

- shell-scripts: command line scripts for data processing 
- sim-scripts: R files for simulations of TD (real and simulated chromosomes)

Processing the vcf data (used in sperm-sim.R)
Packages: to download samtools, bcf tools, and hts-lib (to process VCF data files), http://www.htslib.org/download/. Download to your computer and expand (either by clicking the download button or clicking the folder within Finder). Follow instructions for compiling, working at the terminal from within the Downloads folder (for prefix=, use the aboslute filepath to the folder you'd like to download it to - i.e., $HOME/labfolder/projectfolder NOT ../../project). I keep each in the folders of each project that I use them in.
